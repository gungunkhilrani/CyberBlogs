        <center><img src="./public/Screenshot 2024-07-17 164723.png"></center>
        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>According to a report by EclecticIQ, a Dutch cybersecurity firm, Russian hackers have been using the
            Zulip chat app for covert command and control (C&C) in diplomatic phishing attacks. Zulip is an
            open-source chat app that is often used by businesses and organizations. However, it can also be
            used by malicious actors to communicate with each other and to control infected systems.</p>
            <h4>What Happened :</h4>
            <p>The attacks are targeted at employees of diplomatic organizations in NATO-aligned countries. The
                attackers send emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, such as the Ministry of Foreign
                Affairs of a country. The emails contain links that, when clicked, download malware onto the victim&#39;s
                computer. The malware then establishes a connection with the Zulip server, which is controlled by
                the attackers.</p>
                <h4>
                    How it happened :
                </h4>
                <p>The attacks were first detected in August 2023. The targets of the attacks were employees of
                    diplomatic organizations in NATO-aligned countries. The attackers were successful in infecting a
                    number of systems, but the full extent of the damage is not yet known.
                    The attackers used a technique called "spear phishing"; to target their victims. This means that they
                    tailored the emails to the specific victim, making them more likely to be clicked on. The emails often
                    contained attachments that were infected with malware. The malware can be disguised as a PDF file,
                    a Word document, or an Excel spreadsheet. Once the malware is installed on the victim's computer,
                    it can steal sensitive information or give the attackers control of the computer.
                    
                    The attackers also used Zulip to communicate with each other and to control the infected systems.
                    Zulip is a secure chat app that is often used by businesses and organizations. This made it more
                    difficult for security researchers to track the attackers'; activities.
                    The attacks are a serious threat to the security of diplomatic organizations. They demonstrate the
                    ability of Russian hackers to use legitimate tools and services for malicious purposes. Organizations
                    that use Zulip should be aware of the potential for it to be used for malicious purposes. They should
                    take steps to protect their Zulip servers and to educate their employees about the risks of phishing
                    attacks.
                    The attackers send an email to the victim that appears to be from a legitimate source, such as the
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a country.
                    The infection sequence is as follows: The PDF attachment, named "Farewell to Ambassador of
                    Germany,"" comes embedded with JavaScript code that initiates a multi-stage process to leave a
                    persistent backdoor on compromised networks.
                    The email contains a link that, when clicked, downloads malware onto the victim's computer.
                    The malware then establishes a connection with the Zulip server, which is controlled by the
                    attackers.
                    APT29's use of invitation themes has been previously reported by Lab52, which documented an
                    attack that impersonates the Norwegian embassy to deliver a DLL payload that's capable of
                    contacting a remote server to fetch additional payloads.
                    This connection is further shown by the use of the domain "bahamas.gov[.]bs" in both incursion sets.
                    The results also support earlier analysis from the Anheng Threat Intelligence Centre, which was
                    published last month.
                    If a potential victim falls for the phishing scam and opens the PDF file, a malicious HTML dropper
                    called Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB is launched to run JavaScript that drops a ZIP archive file, which
                    then packs in an HTML Application (HTA) file intended to deliver the Duke malware.
                    Using Zulip's API to remotely takeover the compromised hosts and relay victim information to an
                    actor-controlled chat room (toyy.zulipchat[.]com) facilitates command-and-control (C2).
                    The attackers can then use the malware to steal sensitive information from the victim's computer,
                    such as passwords, email addresses, and credit card numbers. They can also use the malware to
                    control the victim's computer, such as by sending spam emails or launching denial-of-service attacks.
                    The attackers use a technique called "covert C&C" to hide their activities from security researchers.
                    This means that they use Zulip to communicate with each other in a way that is difficult to track.
                    The attackers also use Zulip to control the infected systems. This allows them to steal sensitive
                    information or launch attacks on other systems.
                    The attacks are still ongoing, and it is not clear how many victims have been affected. However, the
                    attacks are a serious threat to the security of diplomatic organizations.
                    The attacks are still ongoing, and it is not clear who the attackers are or what their ultimate goal is.
                    However, the use of Zulip is a significant development, as it demonstrates the ability of Russian
                    hackers to use legitimate tools and services for malicious purposes.</p>
                    <h4>Remediation :</h4>
                    <p>Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication for all Zulip accounts.
                        Keep Zulip software up to date.
                        Train employees about the risks of phishing attacks and how to spot them.
                        Use a spam filter to block emails from unknown senders.
                        Use a security awareness training program to educate employees about cybersecurity threats.</p>
