        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>A group of hackers with ties to China has been accused of carrying out a three-year cyber campaign
            that targeted organizations in 17 countries, including the United States, Europe, and Asia. The
            hackers, who are known as TAG-22 or Threat Activity Group-22, are believed to be operating on
            behalf of the Chinese government.</p>
            <h4>What Happened :</h4>
            <p>In order to find their victims, the hackers employed a number of strategies, such as spear phishing,
                watering hole attacks, and exploiting known security flaws. They also employed a range of malware,
                such as trojans, ransomware, and backdoors.
                Governments, think tanks, universities, and corporations were among the many organisations that
                the hackers targeted. They are suspected of having stolen sensitive material, including government
                secrets, personal information, and intellectual property.
                A cybersecurity company called Recorded Future was the first to discover the cyber campaign.
                According to Recorded Future, the hackers were employing a number of strategies to avoid
                detection, including the use of unique infrastructure and malware.</p>
                <h4>How it happened :</h4>
                <p>China has been charged by the US government with organising the cyber campaign. The hackers
                    were "likely acting on behalf of the Chinese government" according to a statement from the US
                    Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and they were "targeting a wide range of
                    organisations in the United States and around the world.""
                    
                    Any involvement in the cyber campaign has been refuted by the Chinese government.
                    The cyberattack serves as a reminder of the rising danger that state-sponsored hacking poses. State-
                    sponsored hackers can be a serious threat to organisations all around the world because they are
                    frequently well-funded and talented.
                    The China-linked hackers used a variety of techniques to target their victims, including:
                    Spear phishing is a sort of phishing assault in which hackers send emails that are especially aimed at
                    a specific person or business. The emails frequently have the appearance of coming from a reputable
                    organisation, such a bank or government body.
                    Attacks called "watering holes" can place when hackers gain access to a website that is commonly
                    used by their target victims. Once the website has been broken into, the hackers can next introduce
                    harmful code. The malicious code will unwittingly be downloaded onto the intended victims'; PCs
                    when they visit the website.
                    Utilising existing vulnerabilities: In order to access the systems of their victims, the hackers also
                    made use of known weaknesses in hardware and software.
                    utilising various malware: Malware tools utilised by the hackers included backdoors, trojans, and
                    ransomware. Trojans can be used to steal data or install further software, whilst backdoors give
                    hackers direct access to a victim's system. Data from a victim is encrypted by ransomware, which
                    then requests a payment to unlock the data.
                    The three-year cyber campaign by China-linked hackers, which targeted businesses in 17 nations,
                    including those in the US, Europe, and Asia, had a variety of negative effects on its victims.
                    They stole confidential data. According to speculation, the hackers stole critical material including
                    government secrets, personal information, and intellectual property. The Chinese government may
                    use this information to undertake espionage, extort money from people or businesses, or gain a
                    competitive edge.
                    They interfered with business. By shutting down systems, erasing data, and conducting denial-of-
                    service attacks, the hackers also interfered with the operations of their victims. Organisations may
                    suffer considerable financial losses as well as reputational harm as a result of this.
                    They made people nervous and uneasy. The victims of the cyber campaign were likewise shaken by
                    anxiety and apprehension. Possibly out of concern for additional assaults, the organisations that
                    were targeted were hesitant to divulge details about the incident. This might make it more difficult
                    to express oneself freely and work together.
                    Although the cyber campaign's specifics are still being looked at, it is obvious that it was a massive
                    strike with wide-ranging effects. The hackers were highly trained and well-equipped, and they were
                    able to target a variety of businesses.</p>
                    <h4>Remediation :</h4>
                    <p>Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication. Strong passwords and multi-factor
                        authentication can make it more difficult for hackers to gain access to your systems.
                        Keep your software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help to
                        protect you from known vulnerabilities.
                        
                        Use a security awareness training program. A security awareness training program can help your
                        employees to identify and avoid phishing emails and other common cyberattacks.
                        Monitor your network for suspicious activity. A network monitoring solution can help you to detect
                        and respond to malicious activity on your network.
                        Have a plan in place in case of a cyberattack. Having a plan in place can help you to minimize the
                        damage caused by a cyberattack.</p>
