        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>Using the Fenix Botnet to break into specific networks and steal vital data, a
            cybercrime organisation located in Mexico has targeted tax-paying people in
            Mexico and Chile. They then turn the material over to more experienced actor
            groups. As part of their initial infection technique, they clone legitimate portals
            using HTTrack Website Copier/3.x and drive potential victims there.</p>
            <h4>What happened :</h4>
            <p>According to the cybersecurity company with a focus on Latin America, Fenix&#39;s
                objective is to function as an initial access broker, gain access to various
                businesses in the area, and then sell that access to ransomware affiliates for
                further profit.
                According to the evidence so far, the threat actor has been planning phishing
                efforts to coincide with official events since at least the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
                <h4>How it happened :</h4>
                <p>A cybercrime organisation operating out of Mexico by the name of Fenix has
                    targeted tax-paying citizens in Mexico and Chile in order to hack into targeted
                    networks and steal vital data.
                    
                    Cloning the official websites of the Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria (SAT)
                    in Mexico and the Servicio de Impuestos Internos (SII) in Chile and guiding
                    potential victims to those sites is a significant aspect of the operation.
                    Researchers from Metabase Q, Gerardo Corona and Julio Vidal, described the
                    bogus websites as "prompting users to download a supposed security tool,
                    claiming it will enhance their portal navigation safety,"" in a recent analysis.
                    But unbeknownst to the victims, this download really sets up the first stage of
                    malware, making it possible to steal important data like credentials.
                    The campaign's mechanics work as follows: Users who land on the fake
                    websites are encouraged to download software that is said to protect personal
                    data as they browse the portal. As an alternative, people are tricked into
                    downloading safe programmes like AnyDesk via phishing websites.
                    The researchers stated that "[Fenix] compromises weak websites using
                    vulnerable WordPress engines and also creates new domains to launch
                    phishing campaigns,"" adding that the gang "creates typosquatting domains
                    similar to known apps like AnyDesk, WhatsApp, etc.""
                    A.NET binary is then loaded and executed, and the message "Ahora se
                    encuentra protegido" (which translates to "Now you are protected" in Spanish)
                    is then displayed to maintain the ruse. However, the ZIP file containing the
                    supposedly malicious software is actually used as a springboard to activate an
                    infection sequence. This infection sequence then leads to the execution of an
                    obscured PowerShell script.
                    The.NET executable then opens the door for establishing persistence on the
                    infected host and deploying a botnet malware that can execute commands
                    from a remote server, load a stealer module that exfiltrates login information
                    from web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets, and eventually delete itself.
                    "We are seeing new malicious groups being created in LATAM to provide initial
                    access to ransomware gangs,"" the researchers concluded. "These local actors
                    are not amateur and will increase their technical expertise and therefore more
                    difficult to track, detect and eradicate, it is important to anticipate their
                    actions."</p>
                    <h4>Remediations :</h4>
                    <p>Verify the Domain: To prevent typosquatting , thoroughly check the spelling,
                        use of URL shorteners, and legitimacy of website domains. Use web resources,
                        
                        verify domain ownership information, and proceed with caution if you come
                        across phishing efforts or strange domain extensions.
                        When installing third-party applications, use caution: Rely on reliable sources,
                        and carefully examine app permissions. Apps that are not authorised or have
                        not been thoroughly reviewed may access your data, jeopardising your
                        security.
                        Improve Intrusion Detection Systems: Put in place strong intrusion detection
                        systems that can quickly detect and react to.NET binaries and obfuscated
                        PowerShell scripts. This improvement will greatly increase your capacity to
                        recognise threats and successfully counter them.</p>
