        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>Cybersecurity researchers have shared the inner workings of an Android malware family called Fluhorse . The malware we analyzed posed as a legitimate app for an electronic toll system used in Southern Asia. The malware "represents a significant shift as it incorporates the malicious components directly within the Flutter code," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Axelle Apvrille said in a report published. Fluhorse was first documented by Check Point in early May 2023, detailing its attacks on users located in East Asia through rogue apps masquerading as ETC and VPBank Neo, which are popular in Taiwan and Vietnam. The initial intrusion vector for the malware is phishing. </p>
